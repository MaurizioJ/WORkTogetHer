# WORkTogetHer

The project _WorkTogether (or Worth)_ is a tool for the managing collaborative projects. This project is inspired by the principles of the Kanban methodology. 

You can find the specifications and description of project WORTH (ITALIAN language) in the document _Specifiche ProgettoWORTH_v1.1 (1).pdf_. 
Furthermore, you can find my tecnical report in the document _Relazione Worth.pdf_.

The only imported external libraries are _jackson-annotations-2.13.0-rc1.jar_, _jackson-core-2.13.0-rc1.jar_, _jackson-databind-2.13.0-rc1.jar_.

Thank you for your attention.
